      <h4 id="AM-title">About Me</h4>
      <p id="intro">I am about to start my third year as a computer science student at the University of Glasgow. 
I am a highly competent individual, who is motivated and committed to any work I do and was recently accepted into the honours programme for my course. 
I am adaptable, with excellent communication, and the ability to multi-task as well as use my initiative as required. 
I can work to tight deadlines in a high-pressure environment as well as being an honest, conscientious, punctual, and hardworking person who can work alone or as part of a team. 
I have started to use the website ‘code wars’ in my spare time to improve my skills in python, java and teach myself C++, C#, and JavaScript and I am using my time this summer to learn C.
I have also been using 	mhy summer to build my personal portfolio. 
I truly love my university course and I am looking for some industry experience.</p>
